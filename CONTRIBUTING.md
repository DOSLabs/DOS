# How to Contribute to DOS (An Avalanche subnet)


## Issues

### Security

- Do not open up a GitHub issue if it relates to a security vulnerability in AvalancheGo, and instead refer to our [security policy](./SECURITY.md).

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

- Changes from the community that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of `avalanchego` will generally not be accepted.

### Making an Issue

- Check that the issue you're filing doesn't already exist by searching under [issues](https://github.com/DOSLabs/DOS/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/DOSLabs/DOS/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include a *title and clear description* with as much relevant information as possible.

## Features

- If you want to start a discussion about the development of a new feature or the modfiication of an existing one, start a thread under GitHub [discussions](https://github.com/DOSLabs/DOS/discussions/categories/ideas).
- Post a thread about your idea and why it should be added to AvalancheGo.
- Don't start working on a pull request until you've received positive feedback from the maintainers.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Open a new GitHub pull request containing your changes.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- The PR should be opened against the `dev` branch.
- If your PR isn't ready to be reviewed just yet, you can open it as a draft to collect early feedback on your changes.
- Once the PR is ready for review, mark it as ready-for-review and request review from one of the maintainers.
